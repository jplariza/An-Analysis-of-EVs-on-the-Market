# An Analysis of Electric Vehicles (EVs) on the Market 
## Presented by the Busch Consulting Group (Joann Lariza, Anish Gupta, Yingfan He)

### Overview 
Electric Vehicles (EVs) have seen a huge increase in popularity over the past years as consumers and companies have opted for battery-powered vehicles that offer fewer emissions than their gas-powered counterparts. Recent events such as the surge in gas prices have also led to an increase in demand for EVs. 

We wanted to analyze the best EV for an average customer after analyzing the different attributes that make up a car (ex. acceleration, price, etc.)

### Status (as of 04/09/2022)
This project was done in 24 hours, we analyzed the key attributes the best we could within the time period. That being said there may be several relationships missing and will be updated as we work on it further. 

### Code
We mainly used R and Microsoft Excel to develop the graphs we used for our analysis. 

### Installation
If you would like to follow along and run the code yourself, you will need RStudio to run R or open the CSV file provided and create the graphs through Excel.  
From there you will be able to see the graphs that we developed.
